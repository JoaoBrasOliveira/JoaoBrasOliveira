👋 Hello there! I’m @JoaoBrasOliveira

I live in Lisbon, I'm 24 years old and am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Data Science at ISCTE Business School. 📚

In my free time I enjoy 

🔬 Currently, I'm deeply immersed in my dissertation, where I'm applying the knowledge and skills I've acquired throughout my academic journey. I must say it is an exciting phase where theory meets real-world challenges along the financial statement fraud landscape.

💼 Beyond academia, I'm eagerly looking forward to embracing new opportunities that allow me to tackle fresh challenges and create value in one or multiple of my areas of interest 💞️. Whether it's exploring predictive modeling, diving into machine learning algorithms, or uncovering insights from data, I'm ready to make a meaningful impact.

🌱 Driven by curiosity and fueled by a passion for growth, I firmly believe in the power of data to drive informed decisions and catalyze positive change. As Abraham Lincoln famously said, "The best way to predict the future is to create it." I'm committed to shaping the future through innovation and data-driven insights.

🚀 Although I have been learning to make predictions for the last year, I know that: "The best way to predict the future is to create it." - (Abraham Lincoln).Let's connect and explore how we can collaborate
