Hello there! My name is [João Brás Oliveira](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joaobrasoliveira/).

I am currently working on experiments to build a greater understanding of the world.

In here you will find a repository which you are free to clone, download or branch so you can leverage anything you find useful:
- (portfolio) which houses some of my experiments along with the code and ideas associated with them;

Additionally, If you have a question, found a mistake or need some input for a project and think I could help you can email me at jbboa@iscte-iul.pt.
Thank you!
