Hello there! My name is @JoaoBrasOliveira

I am currently working on many experiments to build a greater understanding of the world. In here you will find two different repositories which house all of the code and ideas associted with them (portfolio) and basic ML concepts (machinelearning-madesimple). Feel free to clone, download or branch this repository so you can leverage anything you may find useful.

If you ever have a question, would like to suggest a topic, found a mistake or just want some input for a project you can always email me. Thank you!

JoaoBrasOliveira/JoaoBrasOliveira is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
