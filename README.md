Hello there! My name is @JoaoBrasOliveira

I am currently working on many experiments to build a greater understanding of the world.

In here you will find two different repositories which house all of the code and ideas associated with them (portfolio) and demystification of ML concepts and techniques (machinelearning-donesimple). Feel free to clone, download or branch this repository so you can leverage anything you find useful.

Additionally, If you ever have a question, found a mistake or just want some input for a project you can always email me. Thank you!

JoaoBrasOliveira/JoaoBrasOliveira is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
