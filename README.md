Hello there! My name is [João Brás Oliveira](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joaobrasoliveira/).

I am currently working on experiments to build a greater understanding of the world and improve my skills.

In here you will find two repositories which you are free to clone, download or branch so you can leverage anything you find useful:
- (portfolio) which houses some of my experiments along with the code and ideas associated with them;
- (machinelearning-donesimple) which contains slides I created to better understand ML topics and processes in the breifest way possible.

Thank you!
