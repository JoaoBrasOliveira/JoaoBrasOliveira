ðŸ‘‹ Hello there! Iâ€™m @JoaoBrasOliveira

ðŸ“š I live in Lisbon, Portugal, I'm 25 years old and am currently on the verge of finishing my Master's degree in Data Science at ISCTE Business School. 

ðŸ”¬ In my dissertation, I delved within the exciting real-world challenge that is financial statement fraud detection with the help of machine learning and Large Language Models (LLMs).

ðŸ’¼ I'm eagerly looking forward to embracing new opportunities that allow me to tackle fresh challenges and create value in one or multiple of my areas of interest. 

ðŸš€ Although I have been learning to make predictions for the last year, I know that: "The best way to predict the future is to create it." - (Abraham Lincoln).

ðŸ“« If you are interested, let's connect and explore how we can collaborate! I'm an e-mail away. Just e-mail to: jbboa@iscte-iul.pt
