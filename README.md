Hello there! My name is [João Brás Oliveira](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joaobrasoliveira/).

I am currently working on experiments to build a greater understanding of the world.

In here you will find two repositories that you are free to clone, download or branch so you can leverage anything you find useful:
- (portfolio) which houses some of my experiments along with the code and ideas associated with them;
- (machinelearning-donesimple) which adresses and attempts to demystify certain ML concepts and techniques in the breifest way possible.

Additionally, If you ever have a question, found a mistake or just want some input for a project you can always email me at jbboa@iscte-iul.pt or joaobritobrasoliveira@gmail.com.
Thank you!
